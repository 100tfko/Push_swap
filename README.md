  This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.
</p>


## Key concepts:
<ul>
In this project, we need to create sorting algorithms that can sort stacks with a limited set of instructions.
In the same sense, we must code another program that can check if a set of orders and stacks will make a correct result.
</ul>

## Programming concepts:
<ul>
<li>Sorting algorithms</li>
<li>Stack manipulation</li>
<li>Algorithm optimization</li>
<li>Time complexity</li>
<li>Data structure</li>
  </ul>

## Technologies:
<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>GIT</li>
